### Running E2E Tests

First we need a running instance of neighborhood-cuisine.
We recommend using a local development server.

**Setup neighborhood-cuisine**

See https://github.com/NeighborhoodCuisine/neighborhood-cuisine

When successfully installed, start the instance:

```bash
python app.py
```

**Run the Tests**

```bash
npm run e2e
```
